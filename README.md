# CaliforniaHousingPricesModel
 A machine learning model for the housing prices in California.
 This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing
price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest
geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block
group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts”
for short.

 The model will learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing
price in any district, given all the other metrics.
